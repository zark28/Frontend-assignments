            <h1>The Lion, King of the jungle? </h1>
            <p>
                The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane

            The term "king of the jungle" is a cultural phrase and is not scientifically accurate. 
            Lions do not live in jungles, they reside in grasslands or savannas.
        </p>
        <p>
            The phrase is often used to refer to lions due to their imposing presence and reputation as powerful predators. 
            However, there is no actual "king of the jungle" as the title is just a figure of speech and not based on any scientific classification or hierarchy.
